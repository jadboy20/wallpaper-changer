# Background changer

This project aims to write a python script that will change the wall paper of the desktop.

This project can be split into parts:

1. Change the background to a single image saved in a specific place on the HDD.
2. Change the background to cycle through a list of images in a folder.
3. Change the background to a single image online.
4. Change the background to cycle through a list of images from a website. Maybe a particular theme and pull the images off google.
